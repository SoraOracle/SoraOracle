## 💡 How to Verify More Contracts

For SimplePredictionMarket or future deployments:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet \
  <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  <CONSTRUCTOR_ARG_1> \
  <CONSTRUCTOR_ARG_2>
```

Example for SimplePredictionMarket:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet \
  0x75c0794357966E4fF3A725CcFa5984eF87D86AF5 \
  0xA215e1bE0a679a6F74239A590dC6842558954e1a
