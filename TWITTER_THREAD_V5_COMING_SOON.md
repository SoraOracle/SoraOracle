V5.0 is coming to @BNBCHAIN and it's going to change how you think about prediction markets.

Token minting? Optional.
Every operation? Micropayment.
Market resolution? AI-powered.

Here's what's dropping soon 🧵👇

**Tweet 2/12** 🤔
**The Current Problem:**

Right now, every market forces you to mint a token.

But "Will it rain tomorrow?" doesn't need an ERC-20.
"BTC-100K" absolutely does.

V5.0 fixes this. Finally.

**Coming: Optional Token Factory**

```typescript
// Simple prediction
createMarket({
  question: "Will it rain?",
  useTokenFactory: false  // No token needed
});

// Viral market
createMarket({
  question: "BTC-100K?",
  useTokenFactory: true,  // Mint BTC100K
  tokenSupply: 1000000000
});
```

You choose. Not us.

**Coming: x402 Micropayments**

V5.0 will charge real money for every action:
• Create market: $0.05 USDC
• Place bet: $0.01 USDC  
• Resolve market: $0.10 USDC

Spam? Gone.
Quality? High.
Cost? Less than coffee.

**Why Micropayments Work:**

Free markets = spam hell
Our approach = economic filter

Want to create 1000 fake markets? That's $50.
Want to launch "BTC-100K"? That's 5 cents.

Simple economics. Better outcomes.

**Coming: AI Research Agent**

V5.0's AI will pay for its own data sources:
• CoinGecko: $0.02/call
• NewsAPI: $0.02/call
• Twitter API: $0.05/call
• CryptoCompare: $0.03/call

Multi-source consensus.
Confidence scoring.
Automated accuracy.

**How AI Resolution Will Work:**

1. You ask: "Will BTC hit $100K?"
2. AI queries 3+ data sources (pays with x402)
3. Aggregates results with confidence scores
4. Returns: YES (85% confidence)
5. Total cost: ~$0.06

Human oversight. AI efficiency.

**Cost Preview:**

**Simple Market:**
• Create: $0.05
• 10 bets × $0.01: $0.10
• Resolution: $0.10
**Total: $0.25**

**Viral Token Market:**
• Create: $0.05
• Deploy token: ~$2 gas
• 100 bets × $0.01: $1.00
• AI resolution: $0.16
**Total: $1.21 + gas**

Cheaper than lunch. Better than gambling.

**The New Architecture:**

```
User creates market
    ↓
x402 payment verification ($0.05)
    ↓
[Optional] Deploy ERC-20 token
    ↓
Trading begins (each bet = $0.01)
    ↓
[Optional] AI researches outcome
    ↓
Market resolves
```

Every step = micropayment.
Every micropayment = quality signal.

Weather, sports, daily events - no token overhead

**Viral Token Markets:**  
BTC-100K, ETH-10K - full ERC-20 for community hype

Complex questions get multi-source research

One platform. Three modes. Infinite possibilities.
