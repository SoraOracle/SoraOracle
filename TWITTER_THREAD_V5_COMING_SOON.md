**Tweet 1/12** ü§ñ
V5.0 is dropping on @BNBCHAIN with something we've never seen in prediction markets:

An AI Research Agent that pays for its own data, aggregates multiple sources, and resolves bets automatically with confidence scoring.

This changes everything üßµüëá

**The Problem:**

Who decides if "BTC hits $100K" is true?

You? Too slow.
Oracle? One source.
Community vote? Manipulation risk.

V5.0's AI queries 4+ trusted sources, pays for the data itself, and gives you multi-source consensus.

**Coming: Multi-Source Consensus**

V5.0's AI Research Agent will query:
‚Ä¢ CoinGecko ($0.02/call)
‚Ä¢ CryptoCompare ($0.03/call)
‚Ä¢ NewsAPI ($0.02/call)
‚Ä¢ Twitter API ($0.05/call)

Each source votes.
AI aggregates.
You get confidence-scored truth.

**Tweet 4/12** üìä
**How It Works:**

Question: "Will BTC hit $100K by Dec 31?"

AI Research Agent:
1. Queries CoinGecko ‚Üí $99,847 (NO - 95%)
2. Queries CryptoCompare ‚Üí $99,921 (NO - 92%)
3. Queries NewsAPI ‚Üí "BTC falls short" (NO - 88%)

Final: NO (91.7% confidence)
Total cost: $0.06

Automated accuracy.

**The Agent Pays for Its Own Research**

This is wild:

The AI uses x402 micropayments to access data sources.
No API keys.
No rate limits.
No centralized control.

Just: "I need CoinGecko data" ‚Üí $0.02 ‚Üí instant access.

Decentralized research. Automated payment.

**Why Multi-Source Consensus Matters:**

Single oracle = single point of failure
Community vote = manipulation risk
Manual research = slow + expensive

Multi-source AI:
‚úÖ 4+ independent sources
‚úÖ Confidence scoring (70%-99%)
‚úÖ Automated in seconds
‚úÖ Cost: ~$0.06-$0.15

Better than any human could do manually.

**Real Example:**

"Will ETH reach $10K?"

OLD WAY:
‚Ä¢ Wait for oracle update (manual)
‚Ä¢ Trust single price feed
‚Ä¢ No confidence score
‚Ä¢ Settlement delayed

V5.0 AI WAY:
‚Ä¢ Query 4 sources instantly
‚Ä¢ Aggregate consensus (87% YES)
‚Ä¢ Auto-resolve with proof
‚Ä¢ Settlement: <60 seconds

**Confidence Scoring:**

The AI doesn't just give you YES/NO.

It gives you:
‚Ä¢ Outcome: YES
‚Ä¢ Confidence: 87.3%
‚Ä¢ Sources queried: 4
‚Ä¢ Consensus level: Strong
‚Ä¢ Reasoning: "3/4 sources confirm..."

You see the work. You verify. You trust.

**But Wait, There's More:**

V5.0 also includes:

**Optional Token Factory**
Don't need a token? Don't mint one.
Want viral "BTC-100K" token? Deploy it.

**x402 on Everything**
Create: $0.05 | Bet: $0.01 | Resolve: $0.10
Economic spam filter.

One platform. Maximum flexibility.

## Reply Template - AI Questions

**Q: How accurate is the AI?**
"Typically 85-95% confidence when aggregating 3-4 sources. You see all sources + reasoning, so you can verify yourself. Full transparency."

**Q: What if sources disagree?**
"That's the point of consensus. If CoinGecko says YES (90%) but NewsAPI says NO (85%), the AI weights the confidence scores. You see the breakdown."

**Q: Can I override the AI?**
"V5.0 supports AI-assisted resolution with human final say. Or full automation if you trust the confidence threshold. Your choice."

**Q: What sources does it use?**
"CoinGecko, CryptoCompare, NewsAPI, Twitter API, and more. Each market type uses relevant sources. Crypto markets = price feeds. News markets = news APIs."

**Q: How fast is resolution?**
"5-15 seconds to query sources + aggregate consensus. Then on-chain submission. Total: <60 seconds from trigger to settlement."
