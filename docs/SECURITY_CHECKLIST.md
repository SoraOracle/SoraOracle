# üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist - Mainnet Deployment

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Mainnet

---

## üìã Pre-Deployment Security Audit

### ‚úÖ Smart Contract Security

#### Access Control
- [x] **Ownable pattern** - Only owner can update fees, pause contract
- [x] **onlyOracleProvider modifier** - Only designated provider can answer questions
- [x] **Address validation** - Constructor validates provider address is not zero
- [x] **Ownership transfer** - Standard OpenZeppelin ownership transfer mechanism
- [x] **No hardcoded privileged addresses** - All access configurable

#### Reentrancy Protection
- [x] **ReentrancyGuard** on all payable functions:
  - `askOracle()` - nonReentrant
  - `askPriceQuestion()` - nonReentrant  
  - `askYesNoQuestion()` - nonReentrant
  - `refundQuestion()` - nonReentrant
  - `withdrawProviderRewards()` - nonReentrant
  - `addTWAPOracle()` - nonReentrant
- [x] **Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern** - State changes before external calls
- [x] **No delegate calls** to user-supplied addresses

#### Integer Overflow/Underflow
- [x] **Solidity 0.8.20** - Built-in overflow protection
- [x] **Safe math operations** - All arithmetic operations protected
- [x] **Timestamp validation** - Deadline checks prevent past timestamps
- [x] **Balance tracking** - Provider balance tracked separately from contract balance

#### Fund Security
- [x] **No locked funds** - All BNB accounted for:
  - Question fees ‚Üí provider rewards
  - TWAP deployment fees ‚Üí oracle deployment
  - Unanswered questions ‚Üí refundable
- [x] **Refund mechanism** - 7-day refund period for unanswered questions
- [x] **Withdrawal function** - Provider can withdraw earned rewards
- [x] **No payable fallback** - Cannot accidentally send BNB to contract

#### Emergency Controls
- [x] **Pausable pattern** - Emergency pause stops all question submissions
- [x] **Pause does not lock funds** - Refunds still work when paused
- [x] **Unpause mechanism** - Owner can resume operations
- [x] **Granular pausing** - Only blocks new questions, not withdrawals/refunds

## üîç Code Quality Checks

### Gas Optimization
- [x] **84.9% gas savings** verified on-chain (see TEST_REPORT.md)
- [x] **Packed storage** - Structs optimized to minimize slots
- [x] **Minimal storage reads** - Cache frequently accessed values
- [x] **Efficient data structures** - Mappings over arrays where possible
- [x] **Optimizer enabled** - 200 runs in Hardhat config

### Code Standards
- [x] **OpenZeppelin libraries** - Industry-standard security contracts (v5.4.0)
- [x] **NatSpec documentation** - All public functions documented
- [x] **Consistent naming** - Clear, descriptive variable names
- [x] **No magic numbers** - Constants defined (REFUND_PERIOD, TWAP_DEPLOYMENT_FEE)
- [x] **Error messages** - Descriptive revert messages for all requires

### Testing Coverage
- [x] **43/43 tests passing** (100% success rate)
- [x] **Core functionality tested:**
  - Question asking (general, price, yes/no)
  - Answer provision with confidence scoring
  - Refund mechanism (before and after deadline)
  - Provider rewards withdrawal
  - TWAP oracle creation and updates
  - Fee collection and management
  - Access control enforcement
  - Emergency pause/unpause
  - Gas optimization verification
- [x] **Edge cases covered:**
  - Zero addresses
  - Insufficient fees
  - Past deadlines
  - Duplicate TWAP oracles
  - Unauthorized access attempts

---

## üåê Network & Deployment Security

### Configuration Validation
- [x] **Correct network** - BSC Mainnet (chainId: 56)
- [x] **RPC endpoint** - https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
- [x] **Gas price** - Configured to 5 Gwei (safe default)
- [x] **Private key security** - .env in .gitignore, never committed
- [x] **Provider address validation** - Checked in deployment script

### Deployment Process
- [x] **Pre-deployment checks** - Balance, network, config validation
- [x] **5-second countdown** - Time to cancel if needed
- [x] **Post-deployment verification** - Confirm provider and fee settings
- [x] **TWAP oracle validation** - Error handling for failed deployments
- [x] **Cost calculation** - Track and report total deployment cost

---

## üîê External Dependencies

### PancakeSwap Integration
- [x] **Factory address verified** - 0xcA143Ce32Fe78f1f7019d7d551a6402fC5350c73
- [x] **Pair validation** - Checks pair exists before creating TWAP oracle
- [x] **Interface compatibility** - Matches PancakeSwap V2 interface
- [x] **No admin keys** - PancakeSwap pairs are permissionless
- [x] **Manipulation resistance** - 5-minute TWAP averages out flash loan attacks

### OpenZeppelin Contracts
- [x] **Version pinned** - v5.4.0 (no automatic updates)
- [x] **Trusted source** - npm package, not local copies
- [x] **Audit history** - OpenZeppelin contracts are audited
- [x] **No modifications** - Using standard implementations

---

## üìä Economic Security

### Fee Structure
- [x] **Oracle fee** - 0.01 BNB (prevents spam, remains accessible)
- [x] **TWAP deployment fee** - 0.02 BNB (covers deployment gas cost)
- [x] **No hidden fees** - All costs transparent and documented
- [x] **Fee updates** - Only owner can modify, emits event

### Incentive Alignment
- [x] **Provider rewards** - Question fees go to provider (incentivizes answers)
- [x] **Refund period** - 7 days encourages timely responses
- [x] **Confidence scoring** - Encourages honest accuracy assessment
- [x] **No upfront provider stake** - Lowers barrier to entry

### Economic Attacks
- [x] **Spam protection** - 0.01 BNB fee makes spam expensive
- [x] **No reward gaming** - Provider only paid for answered questions
- [x] **TWAP manipulation resistance** - 5-minute average, minimum update interval
- [x] **No oracle frontrunning** - Questions are public, answers timestamped

## üß™ Testing Evidence

### Testnet Validation
- [x] **Deployed to BSC Testnet** - 0xA215e1bE0a679a6F74239A590dC6842558954e1a
- [x] **Contract verified** - Green checkmark on BSCScan
- [x] **Live testing completed:**
  - Questions asked and answered
  - TWAP oracles created and updated
  - Refunds processed successfully
  - Provider withdrawals working
  - Pause mechanism tested
- [x] **Gas costs measured** - Real on-chain data confirms 84.9% savings
- [x] **Zero vulnerabilities found** - No exploits discovered during testing

### Test Coverage Details
See [TEST_REPORT.md](../TEST_REPORT.md) for comprehensive test results:

- All security features validated
- Gas optimizations verified on-chain
- Edge cases and error conditions tested

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Mitigations

### Bootstrap Mode (TWAP Oracles)
- **Issue:** First 5 minutes of new TWAP oracle returns spot price
- **Risk:** Potential manipulation during bootstrap period
- **Mitigation:** 
  - `canConsult()` function returns false during bootstrap
  - Documentation warns integrators to check `canConsult()`
  - Prediction markets should wait 5 minutes before using price

### Centralized Oracle Provider
- **Issue:** Single oracle provider for question answers
- **Risk:** Provider could go offline or act maliciously
- **Mitigation:**
  - 7-day refund period protects users from no-answer
  - Owner can change provider if needed
  - Future: Plan for multi-provider system
  - Emergency pause allows safe shutdown

### Gas Price Volatility
- **Issue:** BSC gas prices can spike during congestion
- **Risk:** TWAP updates may become expensive
- **Mitigation:**
  - Gas-optimized contracts (84.9% savings)
  - Recommended to update during low-traffic periods
  - 5-minute minimum interval prevents over-updating

## ‚úÖ Mainnet Readiness Conclusion

**Security Status: APPROVED FOR MAINNET DEPLOYMENT**

All critical security checks passed. The contracts are:
- ‚úÖ Thoroughly tested (43/43 tests, 100% pass rate)
- ‚úÖ Gas optimized (84.9% savings verified)
- ‚úÖ Access controlled (Ownable + onlyOracleProvider)
- ‚úÖ Reentrancy protected (ReentrancyGuard on all payable functions)
- ‚úÖ Emergency pausable (safe shutdown mechanism)
- ‚úÖ Economically secure (spam protection + incentive alignment)
- ‚úÖ Testnet validated (live deployment + verification)

**Recommended Actions Before Mainnet:**
1. Final code review by second developer
2. Consider third-party audit for high-value usage
3. Test pause/unpause on testnet one more time
4. Prepare monitoring scripts for mainnet
5. Set up multisig for ownership (optional but recommended)

**Ready to Deploy:** Yes, with standard deployment precautions.
