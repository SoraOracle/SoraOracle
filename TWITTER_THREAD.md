# Twitter Thread: s402 Parallel Transaction Solutions

---

**Tweet 1/15** (Hook)
🚨 We tried to build x402 micropayments on BNB Chain and hit a wall.

EIP-2612 sequential nonces = one transaction at a time.

Here's how we solved parallel transactions WITHOUT EIP-3009 👇

---

**Tweet 2/15** (The Problem)
The goal: Build a micropayment protocol for oracle APIs.

Need: 10 API calls in 2 seconds ⚡

Reality with EIP-2612: 10 calls in 20 seconds 🐌

Why? Sequential nonces. Each transaction must wait for the previous one.

---

**Tweet 3/15** (EIP-3009 - What We Wanted)
Coinbase's x402 uses EIP-3009:

```solidity
// Random 32-byte nonces
bytes32 nonce = 0x1234abcd...
```

✅ Submit 100 txs at once
✅ Process in ANY order
✅ True parallelization

Perfect for high-throughput payments!

---

**Tweet 4/15** (EIP-2612 - What We Got)
BNB Chain USDC only supports EIP-2612:

```solidity
// Sequential nonces (0, 1, 2, 3...)
uint256 nonce = 5;
require(nonce == nonces[owner]);
```

❌ Must process in exact order
❌ Nonce 6 rejected until 5 is done
❌ Massive bottleneck

---

**Tweet 5/15** (The Discovery)
We tested BNB Chain USDC contract:

```
EIP-2612 (permit): ✅ SUPPORTED
EIP-3009 (transferWithAuthorization): ❌ NOT SUPPORTED
```

Why? Binance Bridged USDC ≠ Native Circle USDC

Binance didn't implement EIP-3009 in their bridge 😔

---

**Tweet 6/15** (What We Tried)
```typescript
// Pre-sign 10 permits
const permits = await Promise.all([
  createPayment('api1'), // nonce 0
  createPayment('api2'), // nonce 1
  createPayment('api3'), // nonce 2
  // ...
]);

// Submit ALL in parallel
await Promise.all(permits.map(executePermit));
```

Expected: 2 seconds ⚡
Result: 20 seconds 🐌

---

**Tweet 7/15** (Why It Failed - Visual)
Even though we submitted all at once, blockchain enforced sequential processing:

```
Mempool:
├─ Tx A (nonce 2) → PENDING
├─ Tx B (nonce 0) → PROCESSING ✅
└─ Tx C (nonce 1) → WAITING

Process order: 0 → 1 → 2
Still sequential! 😭
```

---

**Tweet 8/15** (The Breakthrough)
💡 KEY INSIGHT:

EIP-2612 enforces: nonces[owner] must be sequential

One owner = one sequential track
But... 10 OWNERS = 10 independent tracks!

Each wallet's nonces are still sequential, but they process IN PARALLEL! 🤯

---

**Tweet 9/15** (Solution 1: Multi-Wallet Pool)
Instead of 1 user wallet, we use 10 worker wallets:

```
Worker 1 → nonce 0, 1, 2... (stream 1)
Worker 2 → nonce 0, 1, 2... (stream 2)
Worker 3 → nonce 0, 1, 2... (stream 3)
...
Worker 10 → nonce 0, 1, 2... (stream 10)
```

Result: 10x speedup! ⚡

---

**Tweet 10/15** (How It Works)
```typescript
// Create pool with 10 wallets
const pool = new MultiWalletS402Pool(wallet, config, 10);

// Fund workers
await pool.fundWorkers('10'); // $10 USDC each

// Execute 10 parallel operations
await pool.executeParallelOperations([
  'api1', 'api2', ..., 'api10'
]);
```

10 API calls: 2 seconds! ✅

---

**Tweet 11/15** (Why This Works)
Blockchain perspective:

```solidity
// Different owners = independent nonce sequences!
permit(owner=0xAAA, nonce=0) ✅
permit(owner=0xBBB, nonce=0) ✅ parallel!
permit(owner=0xCCC, nonce=0) ✅ parallel!

// All process simultaneously
// because they're DIFFERENT OWNERS
```

We didn't break EIP-2612, we worked WITH it!

---

**Tweet 12/15** (Solution 2: EIP-4337 Smart Accounts)
For UNLIMITED parallelization:

Smart contract wallets implement CUSTOM nonce logic:

```solidity
// Multi-dimensional nonces
mapping(address => mapping(uint192 => uint64)) nonces;

// 192 parallel nonce streams! 🚀
```

Not bound by EOA limitations!

---

**Tweet 13/15** (Smart Account Magic)
From user's perspective:
✅ Submit 100 operations at once
✅ All execute "in parallel"

Behind the scenes:
🔄 Smart account batches intelligently
🔄 Submits to USDC sequentially (EIP-2612 happy)
🔄 User experiences parallelization!

Best of both worlds!

---

**Tweet 14/15** (Results)
Performance comparison for 10 API calls:

Sequential (EIP-2612): 20s 🐌
Multi-Wallet Pool: 2s ⚡ (10x faster)
EIP-4337 Smart Accounts: <1s 🚀 (unlimited)
True EIP-3009 (Base): <1s (not available on BNB)

Production-ready on BNB Chain TODAY!

---

**Tweet 15/15** (Call to Action)
We built s402 (Sora 402) - x402-inspired micropayments for BNB Chain.

✅ EIP-2612 compatible
✅ 10x-unlimited parallel transactions
✅ Honest branding (not x402-compliant)
✅ Production-ready infrastructure

## Thread Variations

### SHORT VERSION (10 tweets):

**1/** Problem: Built micropayments on BNB Chain. EIP-2612 = sequential nonces = slow. Needed parallel txs. Here's how we solved it 👇

**2/** x402 uses EIP-3009 (random nonces) = true parallel txs. BNB Chain USDC only has EIP-2612 (sequential). Can't use random nonces 😔

**3/** Test result: Binance Bridged USDC ❌ NO EIP-3009. Only supports EIP-2612. Stuck with sequential processing.

**4/** What we tried: Pre-sign 10 permits, submit in parallel. Expected: 2s. Got: 20s. Blockchain enforced sequential order anyway.

**5/** 💡 Breakthrough: EIP-2612 = one owner, one nonce sequence. But 10 OWNERS = 10 independent sequences! Each processes in parallel!

**6/** Solution 1: Multi-Wallet Pool. 10 worker wallets, round-robin distribution. Result: 10x speedup (2s vs 20s). Works immediately!

**7/** Why it works: Different owners = independent nonce tracks. Blockchain processes them simultaneously. We worked WITH EIP-2612, not against it.

**8/** Solution 2: EIP-4337 Smart Accounts. Custom nonce logic in smart contracts. Unlimited parallelization. Available on BNB Chain today!

**9/** Performance: Sequential: 20s. Multi-wallet: 2s (10x). EIP-4337: <1s (unlimited). All production-ready on BNB Chain! ⚡

**10/** Built s402 - x402-inspired micropayments for BNB Chain. EIP-2612 compatible with parallel transaction workarounds. Check the technical breakdown: [link]
