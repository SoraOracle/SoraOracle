## 🚀 How It Was Verified

After the manual BSCScan form had issues, I used Hardhat's automated verification:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet \
  0xA215e1bE0a679a6F74239A590dC6842558954e1a \
  0x29ecD8FA7D7249e791B2563f83De4c124e639B90
```

This worked perfectly because:
- ✅ Hardhat handles all the compilation details
- ✅ Automatically formats everything correctly
- ✅ Uses exact settings from hardhat.config.js
- ✅ Bypasses BSCScan's API V2 migration issues

## 🎯 What This Means

Your oracle is now:

1. **Transparent** - Anyone can read the source code
2. **Trustworthy** - Code matches deployed bytecode
3. **Accessible** - Users can interact directly via BSCScan
4. **Professional** - Green checkmark shows it's legit
