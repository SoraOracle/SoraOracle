## ‚ö° Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Add PRIVATE_KEY

The ONLY thing you need to provide is your wallet's private key:

1. **Create fresh MetaMask wallet** (never use personal wallet)
2. **Fund with 0.5+ BNB** (~$300 USD for deployment gas)
3. **Export private key:**
   - MetaMask ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Reveal Private Key
4. **Add to Replit Secrets:**
   - Secrets panel ‚Üí Add `PRIVATE_KEY`

### Step 2: Run Pre-Deployment Check

```bash
node scripts/pre-deployment-checklist.js
```

This validates:
- ‚úÖ Network connection (BSC Mainnet)
- ‚úÖ Wallet balance (0.5+ BNB)
- ‚úÖ USDC contract verification
- ‚úÖ BSCScan API configuration
- ‚úÖ Contract compilation
- ‚úÖ Gas price analysis

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ ALL CHECKS PASSED - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT!
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Mainnet

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-s402-mainnet.js --network bscMainnet
```

**What happens:**
1. Deploys S402Facilitator contract (~2 minutes)
2. Verifies on BSCScan automatically
3. Saves deployment info to `deployment-s402-mainnet.json`
4. Displays next steps

**Cost:** ~0.05-0.1 BNB (~$30-60 USD)

---

## üìã After Deployment

### Immediate Actions (10 minutes)

1. **Update configs** with deployed contract address:
   ```bash
   # File: src/sdk/s402-config.ts
   facilitatorAddress: '0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS'
   
   # File: frontend/src/config.ts
   s402FacilitatorAddress: '0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS'
   
   # File: server/s402-middleware.js
   network: 'bsc-mainnet',
   chainId: 56
   ```

2. **Verify on BSCScan:**
   ```
   https://bscscan.com/address/YOUR_FACILITATOR_ADDRESS
   ```

3. **Fund worker wallets** (need $1,000 USDC total):
   ```bash
   node scripts/fund-workers.js --amount=100
   ```

4. **Test small payment:**
   ```bash
   # Test with $0.01 USDC
   curl -X POST https://your-api.com/api/oracle/query \
     -H "X-PAYMENT: {payment_proof}"
   ```

### Monitor for 24 Hours

```bash
# Check worker balances
node scripts/check-worker-balances.js

# Monitor BSCScan events
https://bscscan.com/address/YOUR_ADDRESS#events

# Filter by "PaymentSettled" events
```

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Deployment (One-Time)
- S402Facilitator deployment: ~$30-60 USD
- BSCScan verification: Free
- **Total:** ~$30-60 USD

### Operations (Monthly)
- Worker wallet funding: $1,000 USDC (reusable)
- Gas fees (10k operations): ~$50
- **Total:** ~$50/month

### Revenue (at 1% platform fee)
- $5,000 volume ‚Üí $50 fees
- $50,000 volume ‚Üí $500 fees
- $500,000 volume ‚Üí $5,000 fees

**Break-even:** ~$105k monthly volume

## üîê Security Notes

### Before Deployment
- ‚úÖ Use FRESH wallet (never personal wallet)
- ‚úÖ Only fund with deployment amount (0.5 BNB)
- ‚úÖ Save PRIVATE_KEY securely (encrypted backup)

### After Deployment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Transfer ownership to multi-sig wallet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limit worker wallets to $100-500 USDC each
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor BSCScan for unusual activity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Set up alerts for large transactions

### Emergency Procedures
- Worker compromised ‚Üí Stop funding, rotate keys
- Contract bug ‚Üí Deploy new facilitator, migrate fees
- RPC failure ‚Üí Switch to backup provider

## üö® What Could Go Wrong?

### Deployment Fails

**"Insufficient funds"**
- Need 0.5+ BNB in deployer wallet
- Add more BNB, try again

**"Invalid nonce"**
- Pending transactions stuck
- Wait or reset nonce in MetaMask

**"Contract verification failed"**
- Auto-verification timeout
- Verify manually on BSCScan (script provides instructions)

### Post-Deployment Issues

**"Payment verification fails"**
- Config not updated with contract address
- Check s402-config.ts, middleware.js

**"Worker wallet empty"**
- Need to fund workers with USDC
- Run: `node scripts/fund-workers.js --amount=100`

**"Transactions slow"**
- Worker wallets not distributed properly
- Check balances, rebalance if needed
