# 🚀 DEPLOY TO BSC TESTNET NOW

## Step 1: Get Testnet BNB (Required!)

You need **~0.25 BNB** for deployment + testing:

1. **Visit the faucet:**
   ```
   https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
   ```

2. **Connect your wallet** (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)

3. **Request testnet BNB** (you'll get 0.5 BNB - plenty!)

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your Private Key

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use a NEW testnet-only wallet!**

### Option A: Create New MetaMask Account (Recommended)

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click your account icon → "Add account or hardware wallet"
3. Create a new account called "BSC Testnet"
4. Get testnet BNB using the faucet above
5. Export private key:
   - Click the 3 dots next to your account
   - Account details → Show private key
   - Enter password → Copy key

### Option B: Use Existing Testnet Wallet

If you already have a testnet wallet with BNB, just export the private key.

---

## Step 3: Update .env File

```bash
# Open .env file and replace with YOUR values:

PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
ORACLE_PROVIDER_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE

# Optional (for contract verification):
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_bscscan_api_key
```

**How to get your wallet address:**
- It's the public address shown in MetaMask
- Starts with `0x...` (42 characters)
- This is NOT your private key (it's public/safe to share)

---

## Step 4: Deploy! 🚀

```bash
npm run deploy:sora
```

**What this does:**
- Deploys SoraOracle contract (~$5-8)
- Deploys 3 TWAP oracles for major pairs (~$2 each)
- Sets up WBNB/BUSD, WBNB/USDT, CAKE/WBNB
- Total cost: ~$13-14

**You'll see:**
```
🚀 Deploying Sora Oracle MVP to BSC...
Deploying with account: 0xYourAddress
Account balance: 0.5 BNB

📝 Deploying SoraOracle...
✅ SoraOracle deployed to: 0x...

📊 Setting up TWAP oracles...
✅ WBNB/BUSD TWAP oracle added
✅ WBNB/USDT TWAP oracle added
✅ CAKE/WBNB TWAP oracle added

🎉 Deployment Complete!
```

---

## Step 5: Update .env with Contract Address

After deployment, add this to your `.env`:

```bash
SORA_ORACLE_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedOracleAddress
```

(The deployment script will show you this address)

---

## Step 6: Start Auto-Updater

This keeps TWAP prices updated every 5 minutes:

```bash
npm run sora:auto-update
```

Keep this running in a terminal!

---

## Step 7: Test Everything 🧪

### Check Prices
```bash
npm run sora:prices
```

### Ask a Question
```bash
npm run sora:ask
```

### Test Permissionless Oracle
```bash
node examples/integrations/integrate-any-token.js
```

### Run Price Alerts Bot
```bash
node examples/utilities/price-alerts.js
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Deployment Commands

## ⚠️ SECURITY REMINDERS

1. **Never use mainnet private keys** - testnet only!
2. **Never commit .env to git** - already in .gitignore
3. **This is testnet** - for testing only, not real money
4. **Before mainnet** - get professional security audit

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds"
- Get more testnet BNB from faucet
- Make sure you have ~0.25 BNB

### "Invalid private key"
- Must start with `0x`
- Must be 66 characters (0x + 64 hex chars)
- Check for typos or extra spaces

### "Network error"
- Check internet connection
- BSC testnet might be slow, try again
- RPC might be rate-limited

### "TWAP oracle deployment failed"
- You need 0.02 BNB per oracle (new security feature!)
- Make sure you have enough balance
- Callers now pay to prevent griefing attacks
