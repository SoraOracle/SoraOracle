# Intelligent Data Source Routing Architecture

## Overview

V5.0's AI Research Agent doesn't use hardcoded data sources. Instead, it **intelligently analyzes each question** and **dynamically selects the most relevant APIs** using GPT-4.

## The Problem with Hardcoded Sources

### Old Approach (Hardcoded):
```typescript
// ❌ Same sources for EVERY question
preferredSources = ['CoinGecko', 'CryptoCompare'];

// This queries crypto APIs for EVERYTHING:
"Will it rain in Tokyo?" → CoinGecko, CryptoCompare ❌
"Will Lakers win?" → CoinGecko, CryptoCompare ❌
"Will BTC hit $100K?" → CoinGecko, CryptoCompare ✅ (only this makes sense!)
```

**Problems:**
- Wastes money querying irrelevant APIs
- Low confidence from wrong data sources
- Can't handle diverse question types
- Requires manual source selection per market type

## Real Examples: Same Agent, Different Questions

### Example 1: Crypto Question
```typescript
Question: "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 by end of 2025?"

GPT-4 Analysis:
  Category: crypto
  Keywords: [Bitcoin, BTC, price, $100K]
  Selected Sources: CoinGecko, CryptoCompare
  Reasoning: "Cryptocurrency price question requires price feeds"

Results:
  ✅ CoinGecko: NO (92% confidence) - $0.02
  ✅ CryptoCompare: NO (90% confidence) - $0.03
  Final: NO (91% confidence) - Total: $0.05
```

### Example 2: Weather Question
```typescript
Question: "Will it rain in Tokyo tomorrow?"

GPT-4 Analysis:
  Category: weather
  Keywords: [rain, Tokyo, tomorrow, forecast]
  Selected Sources: OpenWeatherMap
  Reasoning: "Weather prediction requires meteorological data"

Results:
  ✅ OpenWeatherMap: NO (85% confidence) - $0.01
  Final: NO (85% confidence) - Total: $0.01
```

### Example 3: Sports Question
```typescript
Question: "Will the Lakers win the NBA championship this year?"

GPT-4 Analysis:
  Category: sports
  Keywords: [Lakers, NBA, championship]
  Selected Sources: SportsData, NewsAPI
  Reasoning: "Sports outcome requires betting odds + news analysis"

Results:
  ✅ SportsData: YES (78% confidence) - $0.04
  ✅ NewsAPI: YES (72% confidence) - $0.02
  Final: YES (75% confidence) - Total: $0.06
```

### Example 4: Mixed Question
```typescript
Question: "Will Elon Musk announce Tesla accepting Bitcoin payment?"

GPT-4 Analysis:
  Category: news
  Keywords: [Elon Musk, Tesla, Bitcoin, announce]
  Selected Sources: NewsAPI, TwitterAPI, CoinGecko
  Reasoning: "Requires news monitoring + social sentiment + crypto context"

Results:
  ✅ NewsAPI: NO (80% confidence) - $0.02
  ✅ TwitterAPI: NO (75% confidence) - $0.05
  ✅ CoinGecko: NO (70% confidence) - $0.02
  Final: NO (75% confidence) - Total: $0.09
```

## Data Source Registry

The agent maintains a dynamic registry of available APIs:

| Data Source | Categories | Cost/Call | Use Cases |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **CoinGecko** | crypto, finance, price | $0.02 | Cryptocurrency prices, market caps |
| **CryptoCompare** | crypto, finance, trading | $0.03 | Crypto trading volume, market data |
| **OpenWeatherMap** | weather, climate | $0.01 | Weather forecasts, temperature |
| **SportsData** | sports, nfl, nba, soccer | $0.04 | Live scores, betting odds |
| **NewsAPI** | news, events, politics | $0.02 | Breaking news, headlines |
| **TwitterAPI** | social, sentiment, trends | $0.05 | Social sentiment, trending topics |
| **AlphaVantage** | stocks, finance, trading | $0.03 | Stock prices, forex, indicators |
| **FRED** | economics, government | $0.02 | Economic data, inflation, unemployment |
| **Zillow** | realestate, housing | $0.03 | Home prices, real estate market |

---

## Dynamic Source Registration

Users can register custom data sources **at runtime**:

```typescript
// Register a new API on the fly
agent.registerCustomSource({
  name: 'PredictIt',
  endpoint: 'https://api.predictit.org/api/v1',
  categories: ['prediction-markets', 'politics'],
  costPerCall: 0.02,
  description: 'Prediction market prices for political events'
});

// Now the AI can select it for relevant questions!
const result = await agent.researchMarket(
  'Will Democrats win the next election?'
);

// GPT-4 might select: NewsAPI, TwitterAPI, PredictIt
```

---

## Cost Optimization

The router optimizes costs by:

1. **Relevance First**: Only query APIs relevant to the question
2. **Budget Limits**: Stop when maxCost reached
3. **Source Limits**: Cap at 4 sources by default
4. **Confidence Gating**: Skip low-confidence sources

```typescript
// Example: Budget-conscious research
const result = await agent.researchMarket(
  'Will BTC hit $100K?',
  { 
    maxCost: 0.10,        // Only spend 10 cents
    maxSources: 2,        // Max 2 APIs
    minConfidence: 0.85   // Must be 85%+ confident
  }
);
```

---

## Fallback Mechanism

If GPT-4 fails, the router falls back to keyword matching:

```typescript
Question: "Will Bitcoin reach $100K?"

Keywords detected: crypto, bitcoin
→ Falls back to: CoinGecko, CryptoCompare

Confidence: 0.6 (lower than GPT-4's 0.95)
```

This ensures the system works even without AI access.

---

## Architecture Benefits

### ✅ Cost Efficient
- Only pays for relevant data sources
- Weather question: $0.01 (not $0.10 for crypto APIs)

### ✅ Accurate
- Right data for right questions
- Multi-source consensus reduces errors

### ✅ Extensible
- Add new APIs without code changes
- Register sources at runtime

### ✅ Intelligent
- GPT-4 analyzes question semantics
- Handles complex/mixed questions

### ✅ Flexible
- Supports ANY question type
- Not limited to crypto markets

---

## Integration with x402 Micropayments

Every API call pays with x402:

```typescript
// For each data source:
1. Generate x402 payment proof ($0.01-$0.05)
2. Include payment in API request header
3. API validates payment via facilitator
4. Return data to agent

Total research cost: Sum of all source costs
```
