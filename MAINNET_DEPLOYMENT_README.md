# üöÄ Sora Oracle v5.0 - Mainnet Deployment

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Wallet with BNB**
   - Need 0.5+ BNB for deployment gas (~$300 USD)
   - Create fresh wallet (never use personal wallet)
   - Get private key from MetaMask

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Add `PRIVATE_KEY` to Replit Secrets
   - Verify `BSCSCAN_API_KEY` exists

3. **USDC for Worker Wallets**
   - Need $1,000 USDC to fund worker pool
   - 10 workers √ó $100 USDC each
   - Can start with less for testing

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Pre-Deployment Checklist

```bash
node scripts/pre-deployment-checklist.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ ALL CHECKS PASSED - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT!
```

### 2. Deploy S402Facilitator Contract

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-s402-mainnet.js --network bscMainnet
```

**This will:**
- Deploy S402Facilitator to mainnet
- Verify on BSCScan automatically
- Save deployment info to `deployment-s402-mainnet.json`
- Display contract address

**Expected time:** 2-5 minutes  
**Cost:** ~0.05-0.1 BNB (~$30-60 USD)

### 3. Update Configuration Files

After deployment, update these files with your contract address:

**A. `src/sdk/s402-config.ts`**
```typescript
facilitatorAddress: '0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS_HERE'
```

**B. `frontend/src/config.ts`**
```typescript
s402FacilitatorAddress: '0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS_HERE'
```

**C. `server/s402-middleware.js`**
```javascript
network: 'bsc-mainnet',
chainId: 56
```

### 4. Initialize Worker Wallets

```bash
# Generate and fund 10 worker wallets
node scripts/fund-workers.js --amount=100
```

**IMPORTANT:** Save the private keys securely!

### 5. Test Payment Flow

```bash
# Test with small amount first
node scripts/test-s402-payment.js --amount=0.01
```

### 6. Start Monitoring

```bash
# Check worker balances
node scripts/check-worker-balances.js

# Monitor BSCScan
https://bscscan.com/address/YOUR_FACILITATOR_ADDRESS
```

## Monitoring

### BSCScan Dashboard

```
Contract: https://bscscan.com/address/YOUR_ADDRESS
Events: Filter by "PaymentSettled"
```

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Payment Volume**
   - Daily transaction count
   - Total USDC processed
   - Platform fees collected

2. **Worker Health**
   - Balance distribution
   - Low balance alerts (<$10)
   - High balance alerts (>$500)

3. **Contract Activity**
   - Settlement success rate
   - Failed transactions
   - Unusual patterns

## Emergency Procedures

### If Worker Compromised

1. Stop funding affected wallet
2. Generate replacement wallet
3. Update pool configuration
4. Monitor for unauthorized txs

### If Contract Bug Found

1. Pause operations (if possible)
2. Deploy new facilitator
3. Update all configurations
4. Migrate accumulated fees

### If RPC Down

1. Switch to backup RPC provider
2. Update configuration
3. Monitor recovery
4. Document incident
