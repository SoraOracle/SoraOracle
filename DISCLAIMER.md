# Sora Oracle - Disclaimer & Legal Notice

**Last Updated:** October 26, 2025

---

## üéØ **Purpose & Scope**

**Sora Oracle** is a permissionless oracle SDK for prediction markets on BNB Chain. It provides:
- Manipulation-resistant TWAP oracles
- AI-powered market settlement
- x402 micropayment infrastructure
- Self-expanding research capabilities

This project is **open source** (MIT License) and built for educational, research, and production use.

---

## üî¨ **x402 Protocol Implementation**

### **BNB Chain Compatibility**

Sora Oracle implements the x402 protocol on BNB Chain using **EIP-2612 Permit** signatures.

The x402 protocol enables **gasless micropayments** through cryptographic signatures,
eliminating the need for users to hold BNB for transaction fees when interacting with
oracle services.

### **Protocol Benefits**

- **Gasless Payments:** No BNB needed for oracle data access
- **Cryptographic Security:** All payments verified via EIP-2612 Permit signatures
- **Transparent Settlement:** On-chain USDC transfers tracked on BSCScan
- **Permissionless:** Anyone can deploy markets and oracles

### **Security & Trust**

All payments are cryptographically verified using EIP-2612 Permit signatures. The facilitator
contract handles settlement securely and transparently on-chain. Users maintain full custody
of their funds until signatures are submitted.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Smart Contract Risk Disclaimer**

### **Use at Your Own Risk**

Smart contracts involve inherent risks:

- **Smart Contract Bugs:** Contracts may contain vulnerabilities
- **Network Risk:** BNB Chain network issues may affect operations  
- **Oracle Risk:** Oracle data may be delayed, incorrect, or manipulated
- **Market Risk:** Prediction markets are highly speculative
- **Loss Risk:** You may lose some or all of your funds

### **No Warranties**

Sora Oracle is provided **"as is"** without warranties of any kind, express or implied.
The developers make no guarantees about:

- Accuracy of oracle data
- Availability of services
- Profitability of markets
- Security of smart contracts
- Correctness of AI-powered settlements

### **Audit Status**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** These smart contracts have **not been audited** by a third-party security firm.
Use in production at your own risk. We recommend:

- Start with small amounts
- Test thoroughly on testnet
- Review all contract code
- Understand the risks before deploying

## üí∞ **Financial & Investment Disclaimer**

### **Not Financial Advice**

Nothing in this documentation constitutes:
- Financial advice
- Investment recommendations  
- Legal or tax advice
- Professional consultation

### **Cryptocurrency Risks**

Cryptocurrency and prediction markets involve significant risks:

- **Volatility:** Crypto prices are extremely volatile
- **Regulatory Risk:** Regulations may change without notice
- **Jurisdictional Risk:** May be illegal in your jurisdiction
- **Market Risk:** Prediction markets are speculative
- **Total Loss:** You may lose your entire investment

**Only invest what you can afford to lose.**

### **Prediction Market Regulations**

Prediction markets may be subject to gambling, securities, or commodities regulations
depending on your jurisdiction. **You are responsible** for ensuring your use complies
with local laws.

Consult legal counsel before:
- Creating prediction markets
- Trading on markets
- Deploying to production
- Accepting payments from users

## ü§ñ **AI Oracle Disclaimer**

### **AI-Powered Settlement**

Sora Oracle uses **GPT-4** for automated market settlement through:
- Multi-source data aggregation
- Statistical consensus algorithms
- Confidence-based decision making

### **AI Limitations**

AI models have limitations:
- **Not Perfect:** May make incorrect determinations
- **Data Dependent:** Quality depends on data source reliability
- **Confidence Thresholds:** Low-confidence results require manual review
- **Bias Risk:** May inherit biases from training data or data sources

**Important:** Markets with AI confidence below 85% should be manually reviewed
before settlement to ensure accuracy.

### **Statistical Consensus**

The permissionless oracle uses statistical outlier detection (Median Absolute Deviation)
to achieve consensus across multiple data sources. While mathematically robust, it is
**not foolproof** and may fail if:

- Majority of data sources are compromised
- Market manipulation exceeds statistical thresholds
- Data sources have systematic biases
- Black swan events occur
